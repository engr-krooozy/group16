# Patch and Posey Database Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis for the **Patch and Posey** database. The goal of this project is to derive insights and metrics from the dataset, which includes various entities and their interactions. The analysis will focus on identifying trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and actionable insights through SQL queries and visualization tools.


## Objectives

1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure of the Patch and Posey database, and analyze different entities.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, anomalies, and inconsistent data formats for smooth analysis.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Generate key statistics such as sums, averages, counts, and distributions for important fields.
4. **KPIs**: Measure and calculate key metrics for Patch and Posey, including customer lifetime value, purchase frequency, and revenue growth.
5. **Advanced Analysis**: Perform segmentation, cohort analysis, and time series forecasting using historical data.

### Database Connection

To run the analysis, connect to the Patch and Posey database using a SQL client of your choice. Replace the placeholder connection details in the SQL scripts or notebooks.

Example connection string for PostgreSQL:

```python
import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="localhost",
    database="patch_posey_db",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password"
)
```

### Running the Analysis

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to follow through the analysis steps.
2. Execute SQL queries in the `queries/` folder to extract and transform data.
3. Visualize key findings using Python's visualization libraries or the provided scripts in `visualizations/`.


## Key Metrics & Insights

The analysis covers the following key areas:
- **Customer Analysis**: Understanding the behavior and characteristics of customers.
- **Sales Analysis**: Insights into total sales, growth, and product performance.
- **Financial Metrics**: Revenue, costs, and profitability over time.
- **Forecasting**: Predict future trends and behaviors based on historical data.

## Visualization

Visualizations are an important part of this analysis. Key graphs and charts, such as sales trends, customer segments, and product performance, are available in the `visualizations/` folder. You can generate them by running the provided notebooks or scripts.
